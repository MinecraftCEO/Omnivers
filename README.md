# Omnivers
Idle game


You are a high dimensional being and because you are bored you decide to bring a few carbon based life forms up to your level in a lower dimension by bringing them from a pre-planetary civilization to an omniversal one.

Why? If you have infinite time with infinite possibilities and almost infinite power, you will eventually get bored of being alone on the throne and want to be able to interact with someone on an equal level.
